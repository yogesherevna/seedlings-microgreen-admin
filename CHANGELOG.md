# Seedlings Admin — Consolidated Changelog

This file replaces the previous collection of phase-specific Markdown notes. It keeps the useful historical context without maintaining dozens of competing documentation files.

## Phase 40 — Current baseline

- Subscription Plan Selling Options use the selected Product's active selling options.
- Packaging and Product Selling Price are read-only in Subscription Plan Master.
- Subscription Plan Price is editable on both Create and Update.
- Selling Options block is completely hidden when the selected Product has no active selling options.
- Selling-option plan prices are validated and persisted with selling-option identity and weight.
- Subscription fulfilment was simplified to an order/delivery-occurrence based operational flow.
- Order-based fulfilment allocates harvested Microgreen stock to customer demand.
- Packing records preserve partial/full packing state and batch traceability.

### Recent Admin fixes

- `/products` is the Microgreen Master; user-facing terminology was corrected from Product to Microgreen.
- The unnecessary Featured checkbox was removed from Microgreen Create/Update.
- Microgreen deletion is blocked when referenced by a salable Product; unused Microgreens require confirmation before permanent deletion.
- `/sales-products` remains the Product Master.
- Product deletion is blocked when referenced by Orders; unused Products require confirmation before permanent deletion.
- Subscription Plan deletion is protected when the plan is used by a customer subscription; unused plans require confirmation before permanent deletion.

## Phase 39 — Order-based fulfilment

- Fulfilment is tied to actual customer Orders.
- One-time and subscription fulfilment are distinguished.
- Subscription delivery occurrences use `subscriptionDeliveryId`.
- Harvested batch stock is allocated to demand.
- Partial packing remains pending until the required grams are fully packed.
- Fully packed orders move into the handover-ready lifecycle.
- No Firebase Functions were introduced.

## Phase 38 — Subscription deliveries UAT

- Subscription delivery records represent individual delivery occurrences.
- Delivery lifecycle and handover were kept separate from the parent subscription.

## Phase 37 — Product image and slug validation

- Salable Product images use 1200 × 1200 square validation.
- PNG/JPG/JPEG are supported.
- Files above 1 MB are rejected.
- Product slugs normalize to lowercase and allow letters, hyphens and underscores.
- Invalid characters are removed while typing/saving.

## Phase 36 — Geolocation Master

- Added Geolocation Master and `/geolocations` CRUD using the existing Firestore architecture.
- Existing Rack/production Locations were kept separate.
- Geolocation fields include location name, pincode, charges and active state.

## Phase 35 — Typecheck fixes

- Fixed identified TypeScript issues in customer contact, subscriptions, address handling and order creation/payment receipt handling.
- No intended business workflow change.

## Phase 34 / Delivery Handover

- Need to grow

Historical-demand/confidence controls were removed from the operational screen.

## Phase 27 — Forecast runtime fix

- Existing CMS behavior was preserved.

## Phase 12 / CMS continuation

- Website CMS modules continued using the existing Firestore-backed Admin architecture.

## Phase 11 / Admin loading and validation UAT

- Inventory and Geolocation save states were corrected so successful writes do not leave the UI stuck in `Saving...`.

## Phase 10 / CMS V2-driven development

- Website CMS continued with the established Admin/CMS data model.

## Phase 9 / CMS foundation

- Established the Website CMS foundation and content-management architecture.

## Phase 8 / Security and runtime foundation

- Delivery does not perform a second inventory deduction.

## Phase 5 / Delivery Operations foundation

- Established the initial delivery workflow and its separation from stock consumption.

## Phase 4 — Customers and Orders

- Customer master and Orders were introduced.
- Orders store historical product/price snapshots.
- Reorders are new orders and use current pricing.

- Established the Next.js/AdminLTE-style Admin UI foundation and application structure.

## Phase 2 — Products and Inventory

- Established production Products and gram-based inventory.
- Harvesting adds usable grams.
- Expected/future production is not treated as current stock.

## Phase A — Growing Batches / Production

- Growing Batches support multiple production Microgreens.
- Production quantities are gram-based.
- Growing cycle and production phases belong to the Microgreen production model.
- Harvest records actual gross, loss and net usable quantities.

## Phase B — Salable Product Master

- Salable Products can be Single or Combo.
- Single references one production Microgreen.
- Combo references multiple production Microgreens.
- Component quantities are stored in grams.
- Customer-facing name/SKU/slug and selling options belong to the salable Product.

## Phase C — Packaging & Fulfilment foundation

- Packing bridges gram-based loose inventory and customer packaging.
- Component consumption is atomic for combos.
- Packaging history and inventory adjustments are retained.

## Phase D — Orders / fulfilment integration

- Order lifecycle and fulfilment were integrated while maintaining the boundary that order creation does not consume inventory.

## Phase E — Subscription & Delivery Charges

- Subscription Plan and Delivery Charge masters were established.
- Customer subscriptions snapshot selected master values so later master edits do not rewrite historical customer transactions.

## Phase F — Delivery Operations

- Delivery users, assignments, handover and delivery status became operational Admin modules.

## Documentation consolidation — Phase 40

The repository previously contained 51 Markdown files consisting of old phase notes, UAT notes, runtime fixes and duplicate historical descriptions. They have now been consolidated into five active documents:

1. `README.md`
2. `CURRENT-STATE.md`
3. `DEVELOPMENT-RULES.md`
4. `DEVELOPMENT-ROADMAP.md`
5. `CHANGELOG.md`

Future small fixes should normally update `CHANGELOG.md` rather than creating another phase-specific Markdown file. Permanent rules belong in `DEVELOPMENT-RULES.md`; current system facts belong in `CURRENT-STATE.md`; future scope belongs in `DEVELOPMENT-ROADMAP.md`.

## Growing Batch Sold Quantity / Auto Close

- Existing Growing Batch creation and production planning are unchanged.
- Sold quantity is recorded against the exact batch microgreen from fulfilment allocations when the related order is handed over.
- The existing batch Planned Quantity (the planned production quantity represented by the batch item's tray plan) is the close target.
- When Sold Quantity reaches the Planned Quantity for every microgreen in the batch, the batch is automatically closed.
- Existing manual Close Batch confirmation remains separate.
- Handover records are protected from double-counting through fulfilment-level sold-quantity recording metadata.
## Growing Batch Listing — Active / Closed Views

- Active batches now show each Microgreen as its own row with Planned, Sold and Harvested quantities.
- Active rows show the current production Stage derived from the existing growing phases.
- Sold quantity includes a progress indicator against the batch item's Planned Quantity.
- Closed batches are separated into a dedicated Closed Batches tab and retain the existing compact batch-level listing.
- Existing View Status / View Details actions remain available for both active and closed batches.

## Inventory Batch Selection / Adjustment Updates

- Adjustment history is filtered to the selected Growing Batch when a batch is selected.
- Batch selector options show the batch status in brackets.
- Batch stock adjustment starts from Actual Usable Quantity minus the batch microgreen's Sold Quantity.
- Batch-stock reconciliation compares the requested remaining batch stock with the current stored batch stock to avoid re-applying previously consumed quantities.
- Microgreen aggregate inventory is currently reduced during Fulfilment Packing. Handover records Sold Quantity against the Growing Batch but does not perform a second aggregate inventory deduction, preventing double reduction.

## Inventory batch sold-quantity adjustment
- Batch stock is now read-only in Inventory batch adjustment.
- Sold Quantity is the editable field.
- Added Update Sold Quantity action without changing batch stock.
- Added Close Batch action in Inventory; closing sets each harvested item's batch stock to its sold quantity and closes the batch.
- Removed the manual Close Batch button from the Growing Batch detail view.
- Existing handover sold-quantity recording remains unchanged.
